# 🌳 Class Relationships in Java

> *Understanding how classes relate to each other is the foundation of good object-oriented design.*

## 🌲 The Family Tree of Classes: Inheritance

> *Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from its parent class.*

Think of it like a family tree — just as a Dog is an Animal, a subclass extends the functionality of its superclass.

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

// Subclass inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks: Woof Woof!");
    }
}

public class InheritanceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();  // Inherited behavior
        dog.bark(); // Specific behavior
    }
}
```

**UML Diagram:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Animal    │
│─────────────│
│ • eat()     │
└──────▲──────┘
       │
┌──────┴──────┐
│    Dog      │
│─────────────│
│ • bark()    │
└─────────────┘
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- `Animal` is the parent class with a basic `eat()` method.
- `Dog` extends `Animal` and adds its own `bark()` method.
- The `Dog` class **inherits behavior** from `Animal` while adding its unique actions.

## 💛 Side by Side: Association

Association is a **general relationship** where one class knows about or uses another. It's like a friendship — two entities are aware of each other, but they exist **independently**.

```java
// A Person can have a Car.
class Car {
    String model;
    Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a " + model);
    }
}

class Person {
    String name;
    // Association: A Person "has a" Car.
    Car car;
    Person(String name, Car car) {
        this.name = name;
        this.car = car;
    }
    void goForDrive() {
        System.out.println(name + " is going for a drive.");
        car.drive();
    }
}

public class AssociationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("Tesla Model 3");
        Person person = new Person("Alice", car);
        person.goForDrive();
    }
}
```

**UML Diagram:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│           Person             │
│──────────────────────────────│
│ name: String                 │
│ car: Car                     │
│ Person(name: String, car:Car)│
│ goForDrive(): void           │
└──────────────┬───────────────┘
               │  has a
               ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│             Car              │
│──────────────────────────────│
│ model: String                │
│ Car(model: String)           │
│ drive(): void                │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- `Person` has a reference to `Car`, representing an association.
- Both `Person` and `Car` exist **independently**. The `Car` doesn't rely solely on the `Person` for its existence.

## 🤗 Aggregation: Grouping with a Twist

Aggregation is a specialized form of association that represents a **"has-a" relationship** where the parts can exist independently of the whole — but they are grouped together by a container. Think of a **Team and its Players**: a team has players, yet the players can exist even if the team is disbanded.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Player {
    String name;
    Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Team {
    String teamName;
    // Aggregation: A team "has" players.
    List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();
    Team(String teamName) {
        this.teamName = teamName;
    }
    void addPlayer(Player player) {
        players.add(player);
    }
    void showTeam() {
        System.out.println("Team " + teamName + " has players:");
        for (Player p : players) {
            System.out.println(" - " + p.name);
        }
    }
}

public class AggregationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Team team = new Team("Warriors");
        team.addPlayer(new Player("Stephen"));
        team.addPlayer(new Player("Klay"));
        team.showTeam();
    }
}
```

**UML Diagram:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│              Team               │
│─────────────────────────────────│
│ teamName: String                │
│ players: List<Player>           │
│ Team(teamName: String)          │
│ addPlayer(player: Player): void │
│ showTeam(): void                │
└────────────────◇────────────────┘
                 │ 1
                 │ has
                 │ *
        ┌────────┴────────┐
        │     Player      │
        │─────────────────│
        │ name: String    │
        │ Player(name:    │
        │ String)         │
        └─────────────────┘
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- `Team` **aggregates** `Player` objects.
- Players exist independently of the team — they can join or leave different teams.
- While the `Team` holds and manages `Player` instances, the players are **not solely dependent on the team** for their existence.

---

### 🔑 Key Differences Between Association and Aggregation

- **Association** is a general relationship (friendship) with **no ownership implied**; objects simply interact or use each other.
- **Aggregation** represents a "has-a" relationship where one object (the whole) contains or references other objects (the parts), but the **parts can exist independently** of the whole.

---

## ❤️ Bond for Life: Composition

Composition is a **stronger form of aggregation** with full ownership — if the whole is destroyed, the parts **cannot exist independently**. Think of a **House and its Rooms**: without the house, the rooms cease to exist.

```java
class Room {
    String name;
    Room(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class House {
    // Composition: A House is composed of Rooms.
    private Room livingRoom;
    private Room kitchen;
    House() {
        // Rooms are created and owned by the House.
        livingRoom = new Room("Living Room");
        kitchen = new Room("Kitchen");
    }
    void showHouse() {
        System.out.println(
            "House contains: " + livingRoom.name + " and " + kitchen.name);
    }
}

public class CompositionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        House house = new House();
        house.showHouse();
    }
}
```

**UML Diagram:**
```
        ┌──────────────────────────┐
        │          House           │
        │──────────────────────────│
        │ livingRoom: Room         │
        │ kitchen: Room            │
        │ House()                  │
        │ showHouse(): void        │
        └───────◆──────────◆───────┘
         1 /livingRoom  kitchen\ 1
          1                    1
        ┌──────────────────────────┐
        │           Room           │
        │──────────────────────────│
        │ name: String             │
        │ Room(name: String)       │
        └──────────────────────────┘
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- `House` creates and **controls the lifecycle** of `Room` objects.
- The `Room` objects **do not exist** outside the context of the `House`.
- The composition relationship indicates that a `House` is composed of `Room` objects, meaning the rooms are created and owned by the house and **do not exist independently**.

## ⏳ Just a Little Dependency: Dependency

Dependency represents a **temporary relationship** where one class uses another class, typically via method parameters or local variables. It's like **borrowing a tool for a short while**.

```java
class Printer {
    void print(String message) {
        System.out.println("Printing: " + message);
    }
}

class Document {
    String content;
    Document(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }
    // Dependency: Document uses Printer to print its content.
    void printDocument(Printer printer) {
        printer.print(content);
    }
}

public class DependencyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document("Hello, World!");
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        doc.printDocument(printer);
    }
}
```

**UML Diagram:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Document                │
│─────────────────────────────────── │
│ content: String                    │
│ Document(content: String)          │
│ printDocument(printer:Printer):void│
└────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                 │ uses (dashed)
                 ▼
        ┌────────────────────────┐
        │        Printer         │
        │────────────────────────│
        │ print(message:String): │
        │ void                   │
        └────────────────────────┘
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- `Document` doesn't **store** a `Printer`; it simply uses one when needed.
- The relationship is **transient** and exists only during the method call.

---

### 🔑 Key Differences Between Association and Dependency

🔗 **Association:**
Objects are passed (often via constructors or setters) and stored as **persistent fields**. This creates a long-term relationship where the object is available throughout the lifetime of the class. For example, a `Person` stores a reference to a `Car` and uses it whenever needed.

➡️ **Dependency:**
Objects are passed as **method parameters** and used only within that method's scope. This creates a short-term, temporary relationship where the object is used just for the duration of the method call and isn't stored for later use. For example, a `Document` receives a `Printer` to print its content and doesn't keep a reference to the `Printer` afterward.

## 🎭 Walking the Interface Tightrope: Realization (Interface Implementation)

Realization represents a relationship where a **class implements an interface**. It's like signing a contract to provide specific behaviors.

```java
interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class CashPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using Cash.");
    }
}

public class RealizationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment1 = new CreditCardPayment();
        Payment payment2 = new CashPayment();
        payment1.pay();
        payment2.pay();
    }
}
```

**UML Diagram:**
```
              ┌─────────────┐
              │  «interface»│
              │   Payment   │
              │─────────────│
              │ • pay()     │
              └──────┬──────┘
            ◁- - -   │   - - -▷
           /                   \
┌──────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐
│ CreditCardPayment│   │   CashPayment   │
│──────────────────│   │─────────────────│
│ • pay()          │   │ • pay()         │
└──────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘
```

### 🧩 Explanation:
- `Payment` is an interface that declares the `pay()` method.
- `CreditCardPayment` and `CashPayment` **implement this interface**, providing their own versions of `pay()`.

## 🚀 Bringing It All Together

Here is a **simplified library management system** that demonstrates all five relationships at once:

![LIBRARY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM](../IMAGES/1_LIBRARY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.png)

### 🧩 Explanation

📖 **Readable Interface:**
Defines a contract with a `read()` method. The `Book` class implements this interface, ensuring that all books provide a reading behavior.

🎲 **Book and EBook:**
`Book` has attributes for `title` and an associated `Author`. `EBook` extends `Book` by adding a `fileFormat` attribute. The inheritance arrow (solid line with a closed arrowhead) shows that `EBook` is a specialized type of `Book`.

🔗 **Association (Book & Author):**
The arrow from `Book` to `Author` indicates that every book is written by an author. This is a simple association where **both objects can exist independently**.

🟩 **Composition (Library & Book):**
The filled diamond from `Library` to `Book` indicates composition. A library is composed of books, meaning the **library strongly owns its books**.

📘 ➡️ 📕 **Dependency (Reader & Book):**
The dashed arrow from `Reader` to `Book` denotes a dependency. A reader **uses** a book (for example, to read), but **does not own it**.

🟩 ➡️ 👥 **Aggregation (ReadingClub & Reader):**
The open diamond from `ReadingClub` to `Reader` represents aggregation. A reading club groups readers together, but **readers can exist independently** of the club.
